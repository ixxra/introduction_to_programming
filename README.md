#Annotations on programming with python.

This repository contains notebooks and code writen for my course on programming at [uady](http://www.matematicas.uady.mx).

This course is oriented towards teaching freshman's without a background in programming about data analysis. 

The language chosen for the task is *python*, with *numpy*, *scipy*, *matplotlib* and *pandas*. 

The recommended way to install those libraries is with [anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
