#Notas para el curso de programacion

##Programming notes

This repository contains a collection of python programs and notebooks, I will be using in my *introduction to programming* course at [UADY](http://www.matematicas.uady.mx/)

Some of the programs will be written in *spanish*, others in english, according to the class progress. Feel free to contact me if in doubt.

##Installing software

We will be using [python 2](https://www.python.org/).
The recommended way to install it is with [anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).
